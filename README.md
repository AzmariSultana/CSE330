# CSE330: Numerical Methods

The course will help students to recognize the need for numerical analysis, and the importance of error analysis. They will learn various methods to linearize a polynomial, differentiate and integrate different functions by using approximations, and finally how to solve the linearized equation by using the laws of linear algebra, like Gaussian elimination, QR decomposition, etc.
